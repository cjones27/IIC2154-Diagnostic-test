# IIC2154-Diagnostic-test

This repository contains the solution for the diagnostic test of IIC2154 course.

## Installation

First, make sure you have installed and active your virtual environment
When activated, run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Well done, you are now set for success.

## Running the script

To run the script, in the venv, run
```
jupyter notebook
```
Inside the notebook, you have to run the methods used by the main function. These are below the main function in the file. These are:

- load_data()
- get_most_retweeted()
- get_top_10_users_by_tweets()
- get_top_10_days()
- get_top_10_hashtags()
- main()

After that, you can run the function main.

A `if __name__ == "__main__"` statement was not implemented because it was redeemed useless for the use case.
